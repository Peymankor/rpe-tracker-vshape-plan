# Cloud Sync Feature - Cross-Device Workout Tracking

## 🚀 How It Works

Your workout data now automatically syncs across all your devices using Firebase Cloud Firestore!

### ✅ What's Synced
- **RPE Values**: All your Rate of Perceived Exertion scores
- **Completion Status**: Which exercises you've marked as completed
- **Workout Progress**: Your overall progress through the 4-week program

### 🔄 Automatic Sync
- **Real-time**: Data saves to cloud automatically when you make changes
- **Cross-device**: Open the app on any device and see your progress
- **Offline support**: Works offline, syncs when connection returns

## 📱 How to Use

### On Your Computer:
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:8085` (or your dev server port)
2. Enter RPE values or tick completion boxes
3. Data automatically saves to cloud

### On Your Phone:
1. Open the same URL in your phone's browser
2. Your data will automatically load from the cloud
3. Make changes - they sync back to all devices

## 🎯 Features

### Auto-Save
- Every change automatically saves to both local storage and cloud
- "Auto-saved to cloud" indicator shows when sync happens

### Manual Sync
- **"Sync to Cloud"** button for manual sync
- **"Test Firebase Connection"** to verify cloud connectivity

### Data Management
- **"Clear All Data"** removes data from both device and cloud
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Storage Locations
1. **Local Storage**: Browser storage for offline access
2. **Cloud Firestore**: Firebase database for cross-device sync
3. **Merge Strategy**: Cloud data takes precedence over local data

### Sync Process
1. **On Load**: App loads from cloud, merges with local data
2. **On Change**: Saves to local storage immediately, then to cloud
3. **On Error**: Falls back to local data if cloud sync fails

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Sync Fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Click "Test Firebase Connection" to verify cloud access
3. Use "Sync to Cloud" button for manual sync
4. Check browser console for error details

### If Data Doesn't Appear:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if you're on the same Firebase project
3. Verify the cloud connection test passes

## 📊 Data Structure

Your workout data is stored as:
```json
{
  "rpe": {
    "1-1": [3, 4, 2, 5],  // Day 1, Week 1 RPE values
    "1-2": [2, 3, 4, 1]   // Day 2, Week 1 RPE values
  },
  "completion": {
    "1-1": [true, false, true, false],  // Day 1, Week 1 completion
    "1-2": [true, true, false, true]    // Day 2, Week 1 completion
  }
}
```
